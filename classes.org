This is class 1
** Presentations
*** who am i
*** who are they
** Course mechanics
*** lecture time
- schedule
  - 09AM 1h consulting
  - 10AM 1h practice
  - 11AM 1h theory
- should I prepare slides?
  - yes, I should prepare slides
  - slides accesible from Slack
- in-class mini exercises
  - 3-4 per class?
*** exercises
- off-class problem guides
- guides given on WED due TUE 
- based on reproducible research, guides should be self-contained
  - report in txt/md/tex + pdf format

    - [[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html][markdown rstudio Lesson 1]]
    - [[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html][markdown authoring basics]]
    - [[https://youtu.be/hAyze9cEdZA][video markdown]]
  - working .R code also turned in
*** mid-term exam
- only one mid-term exam
- will have every information at disposal, as in regular research
- part 1. answer some theoretical questions? For instance, 10-20 multiple choice
- part 2. solve a fairly complex problem
- each problem should have zero/half/full points The point is to demonstrate proficiency, allowing
  for some mistakes. Shouldn't pass if every answer is half-cooked!
- sould have an associated recovery exam
*** final project & presentation
- project chosen in accord with me, possibly aligned with own work
- 10-15 page report with working code
- RUBRIC
  - use of tools learned
  - presentation
  - legibility
*** schedule/calendar
- when will the exam be?
- when final projects are due? posters?
*** organization and computational infrastructure
- console R + text editor
- or RStudio
- Slack
- Github: to put my code/data 
** Introducción y fundamentos
- what's R
- R history - 2'
- what we'll learn in the course
- what we willl not learn in the course
*** El rol de R en la programación y el análisis de datos
- FRUSTRATION is natural when you start programming in R, because it is such a stickler for
  punctuation, and even one character out of place will cause it to complain. But while you should
  expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that it’s both typical and temporary: it happens
  to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying.
- hands-on activities is for people to rapidly fail in an environment where they can quickly get
  help
- Ventajas y limitaciones

** Introducción al paquete ggplot2

* Clase 2
** Lenguajes de scripting.
- reproducible research
  - collaboration! most "sciency"
  - future-you! Over time, you want your code to become not just easier to write, but easier for others to read.
    - rewriting is the key to clarity
  - Create an RStudio project for each data analyis project.
  - Keep data files there; we’ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
  - Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.
  - Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.
  - Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.
- Mechanics of console/scripts/editors/etc
** Workflow
- Flujos de trabajo científicos, git y github

- Análisis interactivo de datos científicos
  - operative workflow vs. scientific workflow
